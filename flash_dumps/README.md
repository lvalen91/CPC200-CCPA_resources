> [!CAUTION]
> #1. These dumps are from a A15W (CPC200-CCPA) Adapter with a Realtek Wifi Chipset. Therefor the dumps would should only work on other Realtek A15W adapters. Flashing to a non-Realtek Adapter will possibly result in a bricked adapter. Unable to complete its boot due to kernel failure. Backup your own SPI first just in case.

> [!CAUTION]
> #2 If you have the capability to use these dumps to rewrite the SPI, then I’ll assume you’re also capable of retrieving the necessary firmware blobs from the CFW-Recovery update image. And splicing/incorporating it into your own flash bin.

> [!CAUTION]
> Research shows possible uBoot+Kernel signing based on SoC fuses. While rootfs can be interchanged. The uBoot+Kernel most likely has to be from the original device. See U2air coververtion for further details

> [!CAUTION]
> **`c2air_v821_2026.05.14/` is NOT an A15W dump and the cautions above do not describe it.**
> It is Allwinner V821, **32-bit RISC-V**, Linux 5.4.220, Tina Linux 5.0, AIC8800 WiFi 6, ODM
> Liaoyuan. Different CPU instruction set from every other dump here. Nothing is cross-flashable
> in either direction, and the i.MX6UL fuse-signing caution in #3 above describes the NXP HAB
> chain, **not** this device's secure boot (which is uncharacterised).

> Dumped with `minipro -p 'XT25F128F@SOP8' -r flash_dump.bin` (XGecu T48, macOS), verified by two
> byte-identical reads.

> **Kernel/rootfs test-unit backups are kept separately.** The IW416 bench unit's MTD backups from the 2026-10-19/20 kernel-replacement runs are not in this folder. Its vendor-map mtd0/1/2, the SPI image and the LIVI-state dumps are in [`../custom/kernel_rootfs/backups/`](../custom/kernel_rootfs/backups/), each with its own `README.txt` and `SHA256SUMS`. The naming convention here does not apply to them.
