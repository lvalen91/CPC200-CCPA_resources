OCBM replaces Carlinkit's `0x55AA55AA` projection protocol with an open framed multiplexer over
the adapter's single bulk accessory pipe. This directory holds the tooling to take an adapter
from stock Carlinkit firmware to an OCBM-default appliance, the binaries that go with it, and
the results of doing exactly that on a Realtek RTL8822CS unit on 2026-08-15.

> That is where the actual implementation is — the Rust box daemons (`ocbmd`, `iap2d`, `airplayd`,
> `aa-bridge`), the macOS host app, the OCBM protocol crate, and the full design/protocol

## The route

    stock Carlinkit firmware
      └─ NCM CFW image  ................  custom/firmware/2025.10.15.1127/NCM/   ← START HERE
           └─ ncm_base_install.sh  ......  strip the Carlinkit stack → NCM base
                └─ ocbm_install.sh  ......  place OCBM, prove it reversibly, then default

Optional, and independent of the above:

    dropbear_upgrade.sh   2020.81 → 2026.91   (also gives the box scp/dbclient/dropbearkey)
    busybox_upgrade.sh    1.32.1  → 1.37.0    (402 applets vs 350)

### `scripts/ncm_base_install.sh` — Carlinkit stack → NCM base

`preflight → backup → bootpath → coldtest → strip → audit → coldtest2`

The ordering is the safety argument, and it is not cosmetic. `/script/start_main_service.sh` is
the *sole* launcher of the vendor userspace — `check_mfg_mode.sh`, `colorLightDaemon`, `mdnsd`,
`boxNetworkService`, `boa`, `cpu_UsageRate.sh`, `check_log_size.sh`; `rcS` and `inittab` launch
none of it. So the owned boot path is installed **first**, while every vendor file is still on
disk, and the box is cold-booted through it. Only then does `strip` delete — and by then
nothing it deletes is running or referenced, so it never has to kill a live process. It asserts
that rather than assuming it.

That ordering also disarms `check_mfg_mode.sh`, a 2-second polling loop that does
`rmmod cdc_ncm; echo 0 > .../android0/enable` on `mfgmode=1` (NCM gone) and
`flash_erase /dev/mtd0 0 1 && reboot` on `mfgmode=2`. Do not strip with it running.

Nothing is deleted until a cold boot has returned on NCM unaided. Fail that gate and you abort
with a fully working adapter.

USB storage is one owned mdev hook, `/etc/mdev/usb_mount.sh` (overlay `ccpa/rootfs/etc/mdev/`,
mirrored as `custom/scripts/etc_mdev_usb_mount.sh`). Both `mdev.conf` sd rules run it on add and
remove: `sd[a-z] 0:0 666 */etc/mdev/usb_mount.sh` and `sd[a-z][0-9] 0:0 666 */etc/mdev/usb_mount.sh`.
Add mounts vfat at `/mnt/UPAN` with `-o utf8=1`: a whole disk only when it has no partitions, else
the first partition that mounts, and nothing when `/mnt/UPAN` is already a mountpoint in
`/proc/mounts`. Remove unmounts only when the device on `/mnt/UPAN` is the removed one (or, for a
whole-disk event, one of its partitions), with `umount -l` as the fallback. Events are serialised
with `flock` on the script itself, because mdev runs one process per uevent here (no
`/dev/mdev.seq`). Without the lock, two vfat partitions arriving together stacked two mounts on
`/mnt/UPAN` in 10 of 10 trials on a live unit; with it, 0 of 10. `/script/mount_usb.sh` (the
boot-time staging helper) mounts through the same hook, so it takes the same lock.

*Changed 2026-10-19 (replaces the note from earlier the same day):* the stock `udisk_insert.sh`
(partition rule, `@`) and `udisk_hotplug.sh` (whole-disk rule, `*`) are gone. They duplicated the
mount logic, tested an unquoted glob (`[ ! -d /sys/block/*/$MDEV[0-9] ]`), used `==` under sh,
had no already-mounted check, and never noticed a failed mount. `bootpath` installs `usb_mount.sh`,
checks it for `/mnt/UPAN`, `mount -t vfat -o utf8=1` and `umount -l`, and only then rewrites the two
stock sd rules in `/etc/mdev.conf` (`.pre` kept). The rewrite goes through only if exactly those two
lines change; on anything else it warns and leaves the stock wiring in place. A post-check confirms
that every hook a live sd rule names exists and parses, and restores `mdev.conf.pre` if one does not.
`strip` deletes `udisk_insert.sh`, `udisk_hotplug.sh` and `udisk_remove.sh` (the last one's rule
ships commented out, and its remove branch rebooted on `/tmp/update_status`). A hook that an active
rule still names is kept, and the commented `udisk_*.sh` rules are dropped once none is active.
`audit_scripts.sh` parses the hooks the active rules name, and `busybox_upgrade.sh` parses every
`/etc/mdev/*.sh`.

### The radio platform — chipset-agnostic WLAN/BT bring-up

> **Status (2026-08-15): wireless CarPlay demonstrated end to end on an RTL8822CS unit** — a
> chipset with no backend in this repo — over a SoftAP and Bluetooth controller brought up
> entirely from command lines extracted from that unit's own vendor dispatcher. HEVC 1920×720,
> audio, Siri voice uplink and the full iAP2 metadata stream, steady at 33–36 fps.
> **Broadcom, RTL8733BS and SD8987 remain untested** — the seam resolves them from their own
> dispatchers on paper, which is the design claim, but that claim is only measured on `0xc822`.

The scripts live in `rootfs/script/` here and are placed by `ncm_base_install.sh` as part of the
owned boot path, so a converted unit has a working radio platform whatever silicon it carries.
They are the *only* rootfs scripts published in this repo, and deliberately so: they contain no
chipset payload, so they are safe on any variant. The IW416-specific `wlan_on.sh`/`bt_on.sh` are
not published, because installing one chip's bring-up onto another's board is exactly what the
variant rule forbids.

    rootfs/script/radio_detect.sh   read-only detection; emits /tmp/radio_caps
    rootfs/script/radio_hal.sh      the seam: probe|status|wifi_ap_on|wifi_ap_off|bt_on|bt_off
    rootfs/script/radio_ap_up.sh    the owned SoftAP layer (never the vendor's)

CCPA ships at least six WLAN/BT parts — RTL8822BS/CS, RTL8733BS, BCM4354/4335, BCM4358, NXP
SD8987, NXP IW416 — and **only the driver set for a unit's own chip is in its rootfs.** There is
no fallback set. That is why `ncm_base_install.sh` never branches on a chipset whitelist and
never installs radio scripts from the repo overlay: each unit keeps its own bring-up path.

The gap that leaves: the *callers* still named one chip's scripts. `session_supervisor.sh` calls
`/script/wlan_on.sh` and `/script/bt_on.sh` by literal path, and those are the IW416 baseline's.
On a Realtek unit they simply do not exist, so wireless bring-up fails **silently** — the calls
sit inside a detached `sh -c` whose output is redirected and whose exit status is never read.
Wired projection keeps working, so nothing looks wrong.

The fix is a seam — `radio_detect.sh` + `radio_hal.sh` — that **adopts the vendor's mapping and
not their mechanism**:

* Every unit ships `/script/init_bluetooth_wifi.sh`, the vendor's own SDIO-ID dispatcher, which
  the strip deliberately preserves. Its per-chip `insmod` lines, attach helper/baud, and ordering
  constraints are *observations* — fleet-deployed, working, and not re-derivable for parts you do
  not own. They are extracted and used verbatim, by intersecting the modules in the unit's own
  tarball with that dispatcher's own `insmod` lines. **No chipset table is involved**, so a part
  nobody anticipated still resolves.
* The dispatcher itself is **never executed**. Its control flow is a *choice*, and it carries:
  `attach_bluetooth.sh &` (fork-and-return — the uncoordinated double-bring-up that once fought
  itself for 7+ minutes), the Broadcom branch backgrounding `brcm_patchram_plus` the same way, an
  SD8987 branch that can `reboot` from inside a radio bring-up, per-boot `tar -xvf … -C /` into
  the rootfs, and a BT health check that is object existence — which a dead chip passes.

Three findings from running it on real hardware, each worth knowing before reimplementing:

* **The AP layer must stay owned.** On a stripped box the vendor's `start_bluetooth_wifi.sh`
  reads config through `riddleBoxCfg`, which the OCBM base removes, and the calls are not
  existence-guarded. With it gone the script seds an **empty `wpa_passphrase` into
  `/etc/hostapd.conf`** — persistent, on flash — and falls back to `WLANIP=192.168.50.2`, which
  is NCM's own address, then repoints the DHCP pool onto the management subnet. Its teardown
  `killall`s every `udhcpd`, including NCM's.
* **`hci0` existing proves nothing — and neither does `UP RUNNING`.** A wedged controller was
  observed reporting `UP RUNNING` while every HCI name read timed out. Convergence has to be a
  real round-trip under a timeout. Recovering such a chip needs the attach helper killed, the
  **line-discipline module rmmod'd**, and the reset GPIO driven `1` → `0` (polarity matters —
  the other way is a no-op that looks correct in the log), then re-insmod and re-attach.
* **The interface name is an `insmod` parameter, not a constant.** Realtek loads
  `if2name=sta0`, Broadcom `iface_name=sta op_mode=5`, and on Broadcom `wlan0` does not exist at
  all until something runs `iw dev sta0 interface add wlan0 type managed`. Enumerate
  `/sys/class/net/*/wireless`; never assume `wlan0`.

Measured on the RTL8822CS unit, with no repo backend for that chipset: SDIO
`vendor=0x024c device=0xc822 class=0x07`, firmware tree `rtlbt`, extracted
`insmod /tmp/88x2cs.ko if2name=sta0` and `rtk_hciattach -s 115200 ttymxc2 rtk_h5`, BT-after-WLAN
ordering detected; `wlan0` and a responsive `hci0` (`RTK_BT_4.2`) both came up, with `ncm0` and
the management channel untouched.

### `scripts/ocbm_install.sh` — NCM base → OCBM

`preflight → place → verify → reboot → trial → finalize`

`trial` is the point of the script: a **temporary** switch to the accessory gadget with a
dead-man timer that reboots back to NCM on its own. The host does the OCBM handshake and opens
a root console; whether that succeeds or fails, the adapter returns to NCM unattended. Only
after that does `finalize` offer to make OCBM the default.

Two things that will bite anyone reimplementing this, both learned the hard way:

* **Wait for gadget `state=CONFIGURED`, not for `/dev/usb_accessory`.** The device node appears
  ~100 ms after the function binds, long before the host has enumerated. Start `ocbmd` there
  and it gets `accessory POLLHUP/POLLERR — USB transport gone; exiting for respawn` and dies
  immediately.
* **Bounce the pullup after changing `functions`.** Going from an `ncm` composite straight to a
  vendor accessory leaves the host holding the old configuration: the box reports `CONNECTED`
  (VBUS) but never `CONFIGURED`, and nothing appears in `ioreg`/`lsusb`.

### `scripts/boxsh.py` — telnet transport

Non-interactive driver for `busybox telnetd -l /bin/sh` (IAC negotiation, echo suppression,
md5-verified `put`/`get`). **Prefer ssh** — the box's dropbear negotiates curve25519/rsa-sha2-256
with stock OpenSSH and the root password is blank, so `sshpass -p ''` is enough. This exists as
the independent fallback, which is what makes an ssh-daemon upgrade safe.

### `scripts/dropbear_upgrade.sh` / `scripts/busybox_upgrade.sh`

Both follow the same shape: stage to `/tmp`, prove the binary executes, prove it *works* before
replacing anything, install by copy-then-rename (`cp` over a running executable is `ETXTBSY`;
`mv` is atomic and the running process keeps the old inode), then verify and reboot.

`busybox_upgrade.sh` adds the gate that actually matters, computed on the box rather than
assumed: every applet that has a symlink **and** works today must exist in the new binary.
Applets already dangling do not count. On the test unit: 358 symlinks, 315 working, zero
regressions, 36 broken applets restored.

`dropbearmulti-2026.91-armv7` is a **multi-call binary** (busybox-style, dispatched on
`argv[0]`): `dropbear` / `dbclient` / `dropbearkey` / `dropbearconvert` / **`scp`**. It must be
installed under the exact name `dropbear` or it only prints its usage text.

## Management once OCBM is the default

There is no NCM and no ssh/telnet in OCBM mode. The host client (`ocbm-host`, from the
`ccpa_custom` project) speaks the protocol:

    ocbm-host hello                        # handshake; prints caps + active mode
    ocbm-host console                      # root PTY over the bulk pipe
    ocbm-host push <local> <remote> [mode] # md5/crc-verified file push
    ocbm-host pull <remote> <local>

`caps=0x3f` = CONSOLE, ECHO, MFI, IP, FILE, ETH.

### NCM failover watchdog

`ocbm_boot.sh` can arm a failover (opt-in via `/script/ocbm_failover`): if the OCBM stack cannot
come up, it drops `/script/ncm_only` and reboots, returning the unit to NCM rather than leaving
it unreachable. Triggers are deliberately narrow — `/dev/usb_accessory` absent after 60 s, or
`ocbmd` dead on 4 consecutive checks. **No host talking to us is explicitly not a trigger**: an
appliance in a car or on a bench with nothing attached is healthy, and treating that as failure
would make the box flap between modes. Verdict lands in `/script/ocbm_failover.log`.

Detection is validated in both directions. The recovery *action* has not been exercised from a
real OCBM failure — treat it as best-effort, and keep the SPI image as the actual guarantee.
