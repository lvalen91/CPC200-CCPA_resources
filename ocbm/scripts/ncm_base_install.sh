#!/usr/bin/env bash
# ncm_base_install.sh — take an NCM-capable CPC200-CCPA to the owned NCM base, over the NCM link.
#
# STARTING POINT (required): an adapter already running the NCM .img — `/script/custom_init.sh`
# + `/script/ncm_only`, CDC-NCM armed early in boot, root shell reachable at 192.168.50.2.
# That image is the distributed on-ramp; this script is the CONTINUATION and assumes the link
# exists. It does not bootstrap NCM and will refuse to run without it.
#
# ENDPOINT: the 2026-07-08 baseline (`ccpa/backup/base`) MINUS OCBM — Carlinkit's projection
# stack (riddleBox: ARMadb-driver / ARMiPhoneIAP2 / AppleCarPlay / ARMAndroidAuto / ARMHiCar /
# boa / riddle_top / …) removed, every remaining script owned and dead-reference-free, radios
# on-demand, NCM always-on, UART root console armed before rcS. No ocbmd, no ocbm_boot.sh, no
# daemons — this is the clean base OCBM is then installed onto.
#
# ============================== ORDER OF OPERATIONS ====================================
# 1. preflight    identify the unit; refuse to touch a surprise
# 2. backup       full NOR (mtd0/1/2) + rootfs tarball pulled to the host
# 3. bootpath     the ENTIRE owned boot path, installed while every vendor file is still on
#                 disk: UART console as ::sysinit before rcS, NCM armed as early as boot
#                 allows, and the owned rcS + start_main_service.sh. Deletes NOTHING. The
#                 last of those is what disarms the vendor stack — it is the only thing that
#                 launches check_mfg_mode.sh, boa, mdnsd, boxNetworkService, riddle_top et al.
# 4. coldtest     power-cycle. The box now boots the FINAL configuration, with the old stack
#                 still on disk as a fallback. Must come back on USB-NCM unaided.
# 5. strip        only now delete — and by now nothing being deleted is running or referenced,
#                 so the strip never has to kill a live process. It ASSERTS that.
# 5b. prunelibs   OPTIONAL (--prune-libs): vendor + toolchain libraries, each one cleared
#                 first by a reference scan of what this unit's surviving binaries name
# 6. audit        sh -n every script, scan for dead references and dangling refs
# 7. coldtest2    power-cycle again; prove the STRIPPED box still self-arms NCM
# 8. tidy         OPTIONAL: drop the .pre/.bak copies once coldtest2 has passed
#
# The gate that matters: nothing is deleted until a cold boot has come back on NCM alone.
# Fail at step 4 and you abort with a fully working adapter. Recovery tiers behind that:
# UART pads (armed at step 3) and the SPI programmer with the step-2 image.
#
# ============================== WHAT IS NEVER TOUCHED ==================================
# * mtd0 (HAB-signed U-Boot) / mtd1 (kernel: first 192 KB per-chip DCP-encrypted, rest plain
#   zImage; replaceable via U-Boot staging, but not by this tool) — read for backup, never written.
# * /script/ko.tar.gz — gadget modules built against THIS unit's kernel. Overwriting them
#   with another unit's copy loses the gadget, and with it NCM, and with it the box. It is
#   never REPLACED. Since 2026-10-19 strip FILTERS the unit's own file in place: HeWei's
#   Apple-gadget members (KO_DROP: g_iphone.ko, f_ptp*.ko) are dropped, every other member is
#   repacked byte-identical, and the result must still list cleanly and carry KO_NEED
#   (g_android_accessory.ko, storage_common.ko) or the original is left untouched.
# * ANYTHING WLAN/BT — see the variant rule below. This is the single biggest hazard here.
# * /etc/riddle.conf, unit MACs, dropbear host keys, hostapd SSID/PSK — unit identity.
# * dropbear / telnetd / udhcpd and the gadget itself — that is the control channel you are
#   standing on. The strip never stops them and never bounces the gadget.
#
# ======================= THE WLAN VARIANT RULE (read before editing a kill list) =======
# There are several CCPA variants with different WLAN/BT silicon. `init_bluetooth_wifi.sh` is
# the vendor's own dispatcher and reads the SDIO card ID to pick a branch:
#
#   0xb822 / 0xc822  Realtek RTL8822BS / RTL8822CS   88x2bs.ko / 88x2cs.ko, rtlbt/rtl8822_ko.tar.gz
#   0xb733           Realtek RTL8733BS               8733bs.ko,             rtlbt/rtl8733_ko.tar.gz
#   0x4354 / 0x4335  Broadcom BCM4354/4335           bcmdhd.ko,             bcm/bcm4354_ko.tar.gz
#   0x4358 / 0xaa31  Broadcom BCM4358                bcmdhd.ko,             bcm/bcm4358_ko.tar.gz
#   0x9149 / 0x9141  NXP SD8987                      mlan.ko/moal.ko,       nxp/sd8987_ko.tar.gz
#   0x9159           NXP/Marvell IW416               mlan.ko/moal.ko,       nxp/iw416_ko.tar.gz
#
# The decisive fact (resources repo, 01_Firmware_Architecture/device_variants_and_conversion.md):
# **only the driver tarball for the unit's own chip ships in its rootfs.** An RTL8822CS unit
# carries 88x2cs.ko + rtk_hci_uart.ko and nothing else — there is no fallback set to fall back
# to. Delete a variant's WLAN files and its radios are gone until it is reflashed.
#
# So this script does not branch on a chipset whitelist (an unrecognised variant would fall off
# the end of one). Instead:
#   (a) nothing WLAN/BT is in any kill list;
#   (b) the generated payload re-checks EVERY candidate against `is_radio()` immediately before
#       deleting it, so a later edit to a list cannot bypass the rule — it prints
#       "SKIP (WLAN/BT guard)" and moves on;
#   (c) no CHIPSET-SPECIFIC bring-up, driver or firmware is ever installed FROM the repo
#       overlay, because those are the IW416 baseline's. Each unit keeps its own bring-up path,
#       which means the vendor scripts (init_bluetooth_wifi.sh + attach_bluetooth.sh +
#       start_bluetooth_wifi.sh) are KEPT and become the on-demand radio path, in place of the
#       baseline's IW416-only wlan_on.sh/bt_on.sh. `audit` will list them under "dead
#       references"; that is expected on this base and is not a failure.
#
#       THE SANCTIONED EXCEPTION, because the letter of (c) would otherwise forbid the fix for
#       the problem (c) exists to describe: the chipset-neutral seam — radio_detect.sh,
#       radio_hal.sh, radio_ap_up.sh — IS installed from the overlay, and must be. Those three
#       contain no firmware path, no module name and no attach-helper invocation; they resolve
#       a unit's bring-up at runtime from that unit's OWN vendor dispatcher. Installing them
#       cannot put one chip's bring-up on another chip's board, which is the only thing (c)
#       protects against. `is_radio()` gains `radio_*` so they are also protected from deletion.
#       See docs/wireless/01_BT_AND_RADIO.md. Do not "restore compliance" by removing them from the install list — that
#       leaves every non-IW416 unit with callers naming scripts it does not have.
# Preflight reports the detected variant for the log; it never gates behaviour.
#
# ============================== TRANSPORT ==============================================
# Default is `busybox telnetd -l /bin/sh` on port 23 via tools/boxsh.py: no login, no
# password, no crypto negotiation — the one channel that behaves identically on the shipped
# .img, on a half-stripped unit, and on the finished base. The box's dropbear is old enough
# (SHA-1 kex, ssh-rsa host key) that modern OpenSSH refuses it without a pile of overrides
# and cannot be given a blank password without sshpass. `--via ssh` selects it anyway.
#
# ============================== USAGE ==================================================
#   tools/ncm_base_install.sh install             # interactive: connect, show specs, confirm
#   tools/ncm_base_install.sh preflight
#   tools/ncm_base_install.sh backup

#   tools/ncm_base_install.sh strip --dry-run     # prints the kill list, deletes nothing
#   tools/ncm_base_install.sh strip
#   tools/ncm_base_install.sh prunelibs --dry-run   # optional: /usr/lib + /lib, ref-guarded

#
# Options:
#   --host IP        adapter address (default 192.168.50.2 — NOT .100, that is your Mac's
#                    DHCP lease from the adapter's udhcpd)
#   --pass PW        root password; implies ssh. Omit for the shipped blank-password unit —
#                    `install` prompts for an IP/password only if the default endpoint is dead
#   --via ssh|telnet transport (default ssh, changed 2026-09-05). TELNET IS THE RESCUE PATH:
#                    it exists so a unit whose dropbear/authorized_keys is broken can be repaired,
#                    and it moves files as 2 KB base64 chunks through a line-oriented shell. Do not
#                    route a deploy through it because it happens to be the older default —
#                    measured 2026-09-05, `scp -O` does 1.8 MB over USB-NCM in ~0.6 s.
#   --host-if enX    your USB-NCM interface; forced to a static 192.168.50.1 while waiting
#                    for a cold boot, for when macOS will not re-DHCP the new interface
#   --run-dir DIR    where backups/reports land (default scratchpad/ncmbase_<stamp>)
#   --deep           also drop vendor cruft the baseline dropped but nothing depends on
#   --wifi-backstop  rest on `ncm_wifi` (NCM + Wi-Fi AP) instead of `ncm_only` during the
#                    run, for a second way in on a unit with no UART wired
#   --prune-libs     also run the `prunelibs` phase inside `all` (see the phase list)
#   --keep-web       keep /usr/sbin/boa + /etc/boa. Use when the unit carries a web UI that
#                    is not the vendor's — `baselinediff` warns when it detects one
#   --dry-run        enumerate and report; change nothing
#   --yes            skip the gates (soak/CI use — think first)

# Kill lists.
#
# Tier A is the Carlinkit projection stack and its hangers-on — this is what "the Carlinkit
# protocol removed" means, and all of it goes. Tier B is vendor cruft the 07-08 baseline also
# dropped; nothing depends on it, so it sits behind --deep.
#
# Deliberately in NEITHER list, i.e. always kept:
#   dropbear telnetd udhcpd            — the control channel you are standing on
#   hostapd bluetoothDaemon hcid hfpd hcitool hciconfig dbus-daemon set_wifi_mac
#   the radio stack — see the variant rule below
#
# THE VARIANT RULE. There are several CCPA hardware variants with different WLAN/BT silicon
# (NXP IW416 with `fw_loader_linux`+`hciattach`, Realtek RTL8822CS/RTL88x2CS with
# `rtk_hciattach`+`wl`, and others). They differ in which attach helper, which /lib/firmware
# tree and which bring-up script they need, and a unit that loses its own set has no radios
# and no way to get them back short of a reflash.
#
# So this script does not branch on a chipset whitelist — an unrecognised variant would fall
# off the end of one. Instead: (a) nothing radio-related is ever in a kill list, (b) the
# generated payload re-checks every candidate against `is_radio()` before deleting it, so a
# later edit to the lists cannot bypass the rule, and (c) no CHIPSET-SPECIFIC bring-up, driver
# or firmware is ever installed FROM the repo overlay (those are the IW416 baseline's). Each
# unit keeps its own. The chipset-neutral seam (radio_detect/radio_hal/radio_ap_up) is the
# sanctioned exception and IS installed — it carries no chipset payload; see the header and
# docs/wireless/01_BT_AND_RADIO.md.
# Detection below is reported for the log; it never gates behaviour.

  # ---- the owned boot path, installed BEFORE anything is deleted --------------------------

  # userspace — check_mfg_mode.sh (71), colorLightDaemon (81), mdnsd (85), boxNetworkService
  # (95), boa (110), cpu_UsageRate.sh (132), check_log_size.sh (134). rcS and inittab launch
  # none of it. So swapping this one file disarms the whole vendor stack at the next boot.
  #
  # Doing it first, while every vendor binary is still present, buys three things:
  #   1. the cold boot after this validates the FINAL boot path, with the old stack still on
  #      disk as a fallback and the .pre copies on-box as an undo;
  #   2. by the time `strip` runs, nothing it deletes is running or referenced by any boot
  #      script — so the deletion cannot pull the rug out from under a live process;
  #   3. it stops check_mfg_mode.sh, which is a 2-second polling loop that does
  #      `rmmod cdc_ncm; echo 0 > .../android0/enable` on mfgmode=1 (NCM gone) and
  #      `flash_erase /dev/mtd0 0 1 && reboot` on mfgmode=2 (U-Boot block erased). It reads
  #      mfgmode from sysfs and is 0 today, but leaving that loop running across a strip is
  #      not a risk worth carrying.
